        The curriculum is student guided, that as students develop ideas and interests
        to pursue and implement, that drives the instructions. Thus, the goal of developing
        leadership skills is not rhetoric, but reality. The cirriculum is designed to guide 
        students toward developing a solid foundation for self-esteem, confidence, introspection,
        interpersonal connections and creativity... oh yeah, and happiness.
