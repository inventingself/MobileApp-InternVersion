      <p> Close your eyes.</p>
      <p> Sit comfortably, allowing both feet to rest on the floor, with the spine straight, but not
      over-extended.</p>
      <p> Rest your hands, either palms up or down, upon your lap. </p>
      <p> Take note of your breathing. </p>
      <p> Notice if your breathing is shallow or deep, fast or slow. </p>
      <p> You don't need to change anything, just watch your breath coming into the body and
      leaving the body. Bring all of your attention to your breath. </p>
      <p> Allow your mind to soften. </p>
      <p> Let go of any thoughts of what came before this moment, or what will come after this
      moment. Let go of any judgements, worries, expectations. Just follow your breathing
      and allow yourself to be fully present in this moment.</p>
      <p> *CHIME* </p>
      <p> (Wait until the last sound of the chime has dissipated completely.) </p>
      <p> When you are ready, open your eyes. </p>
